Project: Cryptography Web Application

The project comprises three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.

In the index.html file, there is a plain text message field, a dropdown field, two buttons labeled "Encrypt" and "Decrypt Message," 
and a textarea field where the results are displayed.

In Script.js
This JavaScript program provides encryption and decryption functionalities using Caesar Cipher and Morse Code. 
The encryptMessage() function encrypts the input text based on the selected coding mechanism (Caesar Cipher or Morse Code), 
while decryptMessage() decrypts the encrypted message accordingly. The Caesar Cipher functions (caesarCipher() and caesarDecipher()) shift 
characters by a given amount, while the Morse Code functions (morseCode() and morseCodeDecrypt()) convert text to Morse Code and vice versa.
